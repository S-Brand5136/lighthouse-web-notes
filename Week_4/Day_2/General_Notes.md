## Notes

### AJAX

- _Asynchronous Javascript and XML_

- Ajax HTTP requests don't interrupt a user's interaction with the current web page.
- It allows webpages to be more dynamic by allowing multiple requests to be sent to the serever without nagivation away from the page.
- Ultimately, Ajax is used to get data from web servers into Strings in JavaScript. Commonly the data is transferred as JSON Strings so that they can be easily converted into JavaScript Objects.
