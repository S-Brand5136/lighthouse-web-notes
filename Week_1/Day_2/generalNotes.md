### Tips

- Restating a problem and then breaking it up into pseudocode is a great way to finding out a solution

- Experiment with a reduced version of the problem

- Solve the parts that are the most obvious first, and try to get the simpliest solution working

- Look for analogies. Two problems can look entirely different but require the same solution.

- Trying to solve the part of the problem with the most constraints can help simplify the problem by eliminating possible choices.
