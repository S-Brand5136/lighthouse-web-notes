### Tips

#### Problem solving

- List out the problems your trying to solve

- Restating a problem and then breaking it up into pseudocode is a great way to finding out a solution

- Experiment with a reduced version of the problem

- Solve the parts that are the most obvious first, and try to get the simpliest solution working

- Look for analogies. Two problems can look entirely different but require the same solution.

- Trying to solve the part of the problem with the most constraints can help simplify the problem by eliminating possible choices.

- Figure out the expected out come of the problem. It may not be immediately obvious at first

### Eloquent Javascript

- If its hard to define a name for a function its more then likely taking on too much responsibility

- Stick to the DRY(Don't repeat yourself) method of coding. It forces modularity

- Adding nice and obvious names to functions makes it easier for someone who reads the code to figure out what it does

- Don't add clerverness unless you are absolutely going to need it
