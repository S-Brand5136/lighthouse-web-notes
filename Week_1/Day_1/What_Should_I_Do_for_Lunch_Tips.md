### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```

##### process.argv

`process.argv` is a global object. Arguments are passed to a Node.js Application, and then accessed with the `process.argv` array.

```bash
$ [runtime] [script_name] [argument-1 argument-2 argument-3 ... argument-n]
```

Files are printed out in this order.

- The path pointing to the node executable
- name of the JS file
- the first argument passed by the user

```bash
$ node processargv.js tom jack 43
0 -> /Users/scott/.nvm/versions/node/v4.8.0/bin/node
1 -> /Users/scott/javascript/processargv.js
2 -> tom
3 -> jack
4 -> 43
```

#### console.assert

`console.assert` can be used to write error messages to the console if the assertion is false. If its true nothing will happen

it takes 4 parameters.

- The assertion (any boolean expression)
- A list of javascript objects to output
- A message to print out if the expression fails
- Javascript objects which to replace substituion strings within the error message

```javascript
console.assert(false, "the word is %s", "foo");
// Assertion failed: Assertion failed: the word is foo
```

Emojis can be using to emphasize the code base and log messages

Javascript does not hoist `initializations` ONLY `declarations`

#### modulus

! can be used with % to check for true or false based on if a remainder is returned or not

```javascript
if (!(2 % 4 === 0)) {
  console.log("true!");
}
```
