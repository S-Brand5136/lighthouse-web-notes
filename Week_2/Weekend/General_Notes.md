### General notes

#### Curl

- curl is used in command lines or scripts to trasnfer data

  ```bash
    $ curl www.example.com -i
  ```

- This will download print the HTML and header response from an HTTP get request to www.example.com

  ```bash
    $ curl www.example.com > example.html
  ```

- This will download and store the output in a file

  - o (lowercase o) the result will be saved in the filename provided in the command line
  - O (uppercase O) the filename in the URL will be taken and it will be used as the filename to store the result

  ```bash
    $ curl -o mygettext.html http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html

    $ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
  ```

- Multiple Files can be downloaded in a single shot by specifying the URLS in the command line

  - Syntax for multiple downloads

  ```bash
    $ curl -O URL1 -O URL2
  ```

- We can allow curl to follow HTTP location headers with the -L option.

  ```bash
    $ curl -L http://www.google.com
  ```

- Using the curl -C option, you can resume a download that was stopped early. It's useful for downloading large files that get interrupted

  ```bash
  $ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
  ##############             20.1%

    /// CRT+C to stop the download, and then resume it with the -C option

  curl -C - -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
  ###############            21.1%
  ```

- The Limit rate of a data transfer can be set with the --limit-rate option

  ```bash
    $ curl --limit-rate 1000B -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
  ```

- We can download files that are modified after a particular time using -z option

  ```bash
    $ curl -z 21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html
  ```

- HTTP Authentication can be passed in curl aswell. This can be set with the -u option

  ```bash
    $ curl -u username:password URL
  ```

#### Character encoding

- A character encoding provides a key to unlock (ie. crack) the code. It is a set of mappings between the bytes in the computer and the characters in the character set. Without the key, the data looks like garbage.

- As a developer, you should nowadays always choose the UTF-8 character encoding for your content or data. This Unicode encoding is a good choice because you can use a single character encoding to handle any character you are likely to need.

  - UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication. Defined by the Unicode Standard, the name is derived from Unicode (or Universal Coded Character Set) Transformation Format â€“ 8-bit.[1] -- Wikipedia

  ##### Fonts in encoding

  - A font is a collection of glyph definitions, ie. definitions of the shapes used to display characters.

### DNS

- Root name server (`RNS`) is a name server for the root zone of the domain name system. It directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of `TLD` server.

- Top-level domain is one of the domains at the highest level in the Domain name system. It comes after the root name. They are installed in the root zone of the name space

- A name server refers to the component of the Domain name system. It translate domain names we know like www.example.com to their corresponding IP address
