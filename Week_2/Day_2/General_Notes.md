## Notes

### Callbacks

- Just like with previous asynchronous logic, callbacks are a major way that JavaScript handles dealing with code that needs to run later. 

- callbacks are used for slow code, which takes time to complete.

- A (Computer) Network is when two or more computers are connected and can communicate with each other.

- TCP, which stands for Transmission Control Protocol, provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other. 

- TCP based communication allows two machines to establish an open channel for two-way data communication.
