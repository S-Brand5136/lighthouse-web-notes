### Notes

#### OOP (Object Orientated Programming)

- OO is a software development paradigm
- OO is a popular way to solve code organization, re-use and modularity
- OO is very important to learn due to its popularity
- JavaScript is not strictly OO in the way that Java or Ruby are
- Functional Programming is an alternative paradigm, and one that JavaScript also encourages

#### Dependency Injection

- "passing an object the things it needs rather than having the object access them itself". It makes for code that is much more modular and testable.
