  - Asyncrhonous Programming is when a unit of code is run seperately from the main thrad of the program, and notifes the program when its completed.

  - Javascript leverages callbacks in order to deal with time consuming tasks.

- *BDD* `Behavior Driven Development` covers the entire life cycle of the app development process, from *planning* to *writting* the code

##### There are three major types of testing 

  - *Unit Testing*
    -  Is testing a small piece of code. This could be individual functions if it goes beyong the scope of a function its probably not a unit test
  
  - *Integration Testing*
    - An integration test is testing how different parts of a system work together, like asking a database for some data and displaying it in the terminal

  - *Functional Testing*
    - Is testing the complete functionality of some application. In practice it usually means using some sort of tool to test the web page
