### Notes

#### JSON

- Json is built on two structures

  - A collection of name/value pairs.
  - An ordered list of values.

    ```JSON
      {
        "name": "New York City",
        "boroughs": [
          "Manhattan",
          "Queens",
          "Brooklyn",
          "The Bronx",
          "Staten Island"],
        "population": 8491079,
        "area_codes": [212, 347, 646, 718, 917, 929],
        "position": { "lat": 40.7127, "lng": -74.0059 }
      }
    ```

- Json syntax must be valid Javascript!

- JSON is language independant!

#### API's What are they and Why do we need them

- `API`'s allow us to access a programs code through limited functions. They are like a window into a program
- `API`'s clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software world
- API's help developers leverage other programs to produce functionality they wouldn't be able to on their own
