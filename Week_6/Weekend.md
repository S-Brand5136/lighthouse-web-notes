# Notes

- Declarative programming

  - What you do
  - A declarative approach (WHAT): “Table for two, please.”

- Imperative progamming

  - is how you do something
  - An imperative approach (HOW): “I see that table located under the Gone Fishin’ sign is empty. My husband and I are going to walk over there and sit down.”

- JSX rules

  - All tags must be closed. There are two ways to lose a tag.

    - Use an open and a close tag.
    - Use a self-closing tag

  - A child tag must close before its parent.

  - ALl jSZ expression must result in one root level element. A function can only return one value.

  - No HTML comments
