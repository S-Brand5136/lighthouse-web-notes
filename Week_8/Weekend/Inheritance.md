# Inheritance

- Inheritance is when one class inherits behavior from another

- Inheritance is used as a way to extract common behaviors from classes

- Class Inheritance
  - `<` is used to inherit from one class to another
- Super

  - the `super` keyword is used to lookup methods earlier in the lookup path

- Modules

  - Using modules to group common behaviors allows us to build a more powerful, flexible and DRY design.

- You can only subclass from one class, but you can mixin modules as much as you like

- If there is a "is-a" relationship class inheritiance will do.
- If there's a "has-a" relationship, interface inheritance is generally a better choice.

- Namespacing

  - namespacing means oragnizing similar classes under a module

- Method access Control

  - Public

    - available to everyone

  - Private

    - Only available to the inner class

  - Protected
    - Available to everyone, but can only be altered inside the class
